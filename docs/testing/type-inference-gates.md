# Type inference gates

Two scripts in `.github/scripts/` guard the generated TypeScript against the two ways type inference
fails silently. Both run in CI (`.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`, job `type-inference-gates`) and both
can be run locally.

They exist because **a green test suite does not prove the generated types are right.** A unit test can
pass against an inner helper while the pipeline still emits a wrong type, and a fixture can pass while
emitting TypeScript that does not compile. These gates check the committed output itself.

Types are gated here; speed is gated separately — see
[`performance-gate.md`](performance-gate.md) for the publish-speed A/B gate.

| Script                       | Catches                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unknown-regression-gate.py` | A property that had a real type now emits `unknown`                          |
| `unimportable-token-gate.sh` | A type token emitted without its `import` — TypeScript that will not compile |

The two are complements, not overlaps. A leaked token is a *new* property carrying a plausible-looking
type, not an existing property degrading, so the regression gate structurally cannot see it.

## `unknown-regression-gate.py`

Compares the committed type trees under `workbench/resources/js/types/data` at two revisions and fails if
a property that carried a real type now emits one containing `unknown`. One blind spot survives by
design: an inline object that *already* carries an `unknown` member anywhere cannot report its own
wholesale collapse. See [What the gates do not cover](#what-the-gates-do-not-cover).

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/unknown-regression-gate.py [BASE_REV] [HEAD_REV]
```

`BASE_REV` defaults to the branch point of the type-inference work; `HEAD_REV` defaults to `HEAD`.

```
base properties: 17072   head properties: <moves with every regeneration>
PASS - no property regressed to unknown
```

The base count is stable, because `BASE_REV` is a pinned commit and only a change to this script's own
parser moves it. The head count changes whenever the trees are regenerated, so it is left as a
placeholder rather than a literal that rots on every commit. Neither number is load-bearing; the
`PASS`/`FAIL` line is.

Because it reads both sides out of git, it also enforces that regenerated output was **committed** — a
change that improves inference but leaves the trees stale compares against itself and reports nothing.

Every property is keyed by `(file, enclosing interface/namespace path, property name)`. The scope matters:
without it, `Invoice.status` and `InvoiceResource.status` collide, and the nested namespaces in
`laravel-ts-global.ts` collapse into one bucket. An earlier version of this script keyed on file and name
only, silently conflated ~116 pairs, and could never fail.

### Aliases and inline-object members

Single-line `export type X = …;` aliases are parsed the same way as properties, keyed by their name —
including a namespaced alias nested inside `declare global { namespace … { type X = …; } }`. When a
property's or alias's value contains one or more inline `{ … }` object types, each member becomes its own
key *in addition to* the parent: `prop.member` for a single object, `prop[i].member` per arm for a union of
objects, alongside `prop` itself holding the whole rendered value. A member regressing to `unknown` is
therefore not masked by an already-`unknown` sibling in the same object, and a property whose whole inline
object collapses to a bare `unknown` still matches its own base key rather than sharing none — provided
that object was entirely real-typed at base. If it was not, see the residual below.

Keeping the parent is what makes the whole-object case visible at all. When only the members were keyed,
a base holding `heading_content.title` and `heading_content.summary` and a head holding just
`heading_content: unknown` had no key in common, and `detect_regressions()` — which iterates
`for k in h if k in b` — matched nothing and reported zero regressions.

The parent key holds the whole rendered value, so it is coarse on purpose: it also fires when an existing
object merely *gains* a member typed `unknown`, since that member is a new key with no base counterpart
and nothing else in the gate would see it. Treat such a failure as a real question to answer, not as
noise to silence.

`prop[i]` is a positional index into the arms as written, not a content hash: reordering two union arms in a
regenerated file shifts which arm sits at index `0` and can mask a regression. This is a known, accepted
limit — not something a future change to this gate should try to fix with content-hashed arm keys.

A `Pick<Model, K>` reference is the companion case: it has no `{` for the member-splitting logic to
descend into, so it stays a single opaque key rather than expanding into `prop.member`/`prop[i].member`
entries. This is de-duplicated coverage, not lost coverage — the members `Pick<>` names still live in
`Model`'s own generated file (e.g. `app/models/user.ts`), which this same gate already watches, so a
regression on one of them still fails here, just keyed under the model file instead of the resource
that references it.

### Parser self-test

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/unknown-regression-gate.py --parsetest
```

No commit in this repo's history exercises a member-level `FAIL`, so this self-test is the only guard on
the alias-, parent- and member-splitting logic above. Measured, not assumed: 190 commits have touched the
generated tree (`git rev-list --count HEAD -- workbench/resources/js/types/data`), and replaying each of
the 185 parent→commit transitions that changed a `.ts` file through `parse_source()` and
`detect_regressions()` reports a regression on 2 of them and a **member-level** regression on **0**. That
covers consecutive transitions, not every possible `BASE..HEAD` pair, so it is a strong absence rather
than a proof. It checks seven cases: five lifted from the
corpus — a single-line type alias, a namespaced alias inside `declare global`, an inline object with one
member, one with several members, and a union of two inline objects — plus two synthetic regressions. The
first is a member degrading to `unknown` beside a sibling that is already `unknown[]`, the exact shape the
whole-string `FAIL` test below used to miss. The second is a whole inline object collapsing to a bare
`unknown`, the shape member-splitting itself used to miss. Run it after any change to this script.

### Self-test

The gate has a known-bad range built in. Use it whenever you change the script:

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/unknown-regression-gate.py 0faf1f5 3880323 --selftest
```

That range deliberately turned `TrackingEvent.status` from `string` into `unknown`, so the script must
report **16 regressions** (four template trees × the model and its resource, plus the global files).
`--selftest` inverts the exit code: finding the regressions is success. A `PASS` here means the script is
broken, not the code.

### When it fails

A property degraded. Do not restore the old value and do not accept `unknown` — find the real type. The
old value may itself have been wrong: when `TrackingEvent.status` first degraded, the previous `string`
turned out to be a lie masking a broken cast (the model imported an enum's *TypeScript* alias instead of
its PHP class, and the namespace segment `\Enums\` was substring-matching the `enum` map key). The correct
answer was neither `string` nor `unknown` but `ShipmentStatusType`.

## `unimportable-token-gate.sh`

Runs `npx tsc --noEmit` over the generated tree and counts "cannot find name" diagnostics — TS2304, plus
TS2552 (`Did you mean…`), which TypeScript emits instead when a similarly-named global exists — together
with TS2300 (`Duplicate identifier`), TS2440 (`Import declaration conflicts with local declaration`),
TS2344 (`does not satisfy the constraint`) and TS2305/TS2724 (`has no exported member`).

**All three baselines are `0`.** The app-side modules the generated tree imports are stubbed under
`tests/types/stubs` (see [The app-side stubs](#the-app-side-stubs)), so the gate is an *identity* check
rather than a cardinality one: any unresolvable module, any name a stub does not export, any bad `Pick`
key fails immediately. A count-based baseline could not do that — at a baseline of 61, one baseline
diagnostic disappearing while a genuinely new leaked token appeared still totalled 61 and passed.

TS2300 catches a different failure shape than the other two: not a token emitted *without* an import, but
two *different* imports resolving to the *same* local name. This is exactly how the MailPrice collision
manifested — two unrelated `MailPrice` models both aliased to `MailPriceMailPrice`, because the old aliasing
algorithm derived an alias from a single namespace segment and two classes happened to share both their
basename and that segment. `ImportNameRegistry` (`docs/components/import-name-registry.md`) exists to make
that impossible, and this gate is the standing check that it stays that way.

TS2440 is that collision one step over: an import colliding with a *local* declaration of the same name
rather than with a second import. Same defect class, but TypeScript files it under its own code, so the
grep has to name it explicitly — until it did, a generated file declaring a name it also imported read as
a clean `0` and the gate exited 0. It was armed while the count was already `0`, so no baseline moved.

TS2344 is a third shape: the token is imported and unique, but named somewhere its own type rejects it —
the case that motivated adding it was `Pick<Model, K>` built from raw schema columns while the model
interface omits `$hidden` ones, so `K extends keyof T` failed. See
`docs/components/resource-ast-analyzer.md`.

```bash
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh              # report only
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0            # fail on any counted name diagnostic
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0 0 0        # also gate both TS2307 sub-counts
```

```
TS2300/TS2304/TS2305/TS2344/TS2440/TS2552/TS2724 (duplicate identifier / cannot find name / unexported name / bad type argument / import-local conflict) in generated tree: 0
TS2307 (cannot find module) with a relative specifier in generated tree: 0
TS2307 (cannot find module) with a bare specifier in generated tree: 0

PASS - no new unimportable or colliding tokens (baseline 0)
PASS - no new relative-specifier TS2307s (baseline 0)
PASS - no new bare-specifier TS2307s (baseline 0)
```

Each zero count prints one blank histogram line — `printf '%s\n' ""` on an empty match. Cosmetic, and now
the permanent steady state.

### The app-side stubs

The generated TypeScript imports from aliased modules that do not exist in this repo *by design* — they are
named by `#[TsCasts]` / `#[TsExtends]` / `#[TsType]` and belong to the consuming application. Those imports
used to be absorbed as a numeric baseline. They are now **resolved** instead, against hand-written stubs:

| Alias | Stub | Exports |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@/types/*` | `tests/types/stubs/app/*.d.ts` | 14 modules, 15 names |
| `@js/types/*` | `tests/types/stubs/js/*.d.ts` | 6 modules, 7 names |
| `@workbench/types` | `tests/types/stubs/workbench/index.d.ts` | `PageMeta` |
| *(no import — bare globals)* | `tests/types/stubs/globals.d.ts` | `CustomObject`, `ExtendableInterface` |

`tsconfig.json`'s `paths` maps the three aliases at the stub directories. There is no `baseUrl`; TS 5+ with
`moduleResolution: "bundler"` accepts `./`-relative `paths` values without one.

Three rules keep the stubs honest, and all three are the point of the exercise:

1. **Each module declares exactly the names the generated tree imports — no more, no fewer.** No wildcard
   `declare module '@/types/*'`, no `any`, no blanket declaration that would make an arbitrary specifier
   resolve. A blanket declaration would restore precisely the tolerance the zero baseline removes.
2. **They are hand-maintained fixtures, never generated from the output.** Deriving them from the generated
   tree at gate time would check that tree against itself and always pass.
3. **Members exist only where a type operator demands them.** `Auditable` carries `created_by`/`updated_by`
   and `Routable` carries `store`/`update` because `Pick<T, K>` constrains `K extends keyof T` and would
   otherwise raise TS2344 — a code this gate counts. `Timestamps` carries `created_at`/`updated_at` so the
   generated `Omit<Timestamps, …>` removes something rather than omitting from an empty type. Everything
   else is an empty `interface`, which is what the `extends` positions require (a type alias to a primitive
   would not be extendable). Members are typed `unknown`: honest, since the package genuinely does not know
   the app's shape, and maximally permissive as a base — a derived interface redeclaring `created_by: number`
   still satisfies assignability.

`globals.d.ts` needs `export {}` plus `declare global { … }`: `moduleDetection: "force"` makes every
non-declaration file a module, and a bare `interface` in a module file would not be global.

**Adding a fixture that imports a new app-side name means adding it to the stub by hand.** That is not
friction to route around — it is the gate working. The alternative, raising a baseline, is what let a
swapped token through.

### History: the former TS2304 baseline

Kept because the origins are worth re-deriving rather than assuming. This bucket was **10** until the stubs
took it to 0, and it was **not** made of `custom_ts_mappings` entries. The workbench's
`custom_ts_mappings` is empty (`workbench/config/ts-publish.php:80-82` holds only a commented-out example),
so it contributes none of the 10. Traced to source, the two surviving names are:

| Name | Count | Where it comes from | Expected? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CustomObject` | 8 | A `@return array{…, custom_val: CustomObject, …}` docblock shape in `workbench/app/Http/Resources/Concerns/IncludesExtras.php`. A resource docblock shape map is string-only, so it carries no FQCN and no import can be derived. | Yes — app-declared |
| `ExtendableInterface` | 2 | `#[TsExtends('ExtendableInterface')]` on `workbench/app/Http/Resources/Concerns/ExtendsInterfaces.php`, with no import argument. (Its sibling `#[TsExtends(…, '@/types/util', …)]` on the next line passes one and resolves fine.) | Yes — app-declared |

Both names are genuine escape hatches, in two different flavors, neither of them `custom_ts_mappings`: the
*consuming app* declares the type and the package has no FQCN or import path to work from. They are expected
and must not be "fixed". As of this measurement the bucket holds nothing else — but it has held real defects
before, so re-derive rather than assume; the two most recent are recorded below.

`PostAttributes` sat in this bucket until the count dropped from 12 to 11.
`GlobalsWriter` built its `$externalTypeImports` map (`src/Writers/GlobalsWriter.php`, the block beginning
at the comment "Collect external (non-relative) type imports") from three generator collections —
`modelGenerators`' `customImports`, `resourceGenerators`' non-relative `typeImports`, and
`broadcastEventGenerators`' non-relative `typeImports` — with `formRequestGenerators` absent, so
`UpdatePostRequest`'s `#[TsCasts(['attributes' => ['type' => 'PostAttributes', 'import' => '@js/types/posts']])]`
reached the modular flavor and was dropped on the way to the global one. A fourth loop over
`formRequestGenerators` closed that. (`enumGenerators` is still absent from that map, but `EnumTransformer`
declares no import channel at all, so that is not a gap.)

The measured effect was a move, not a removal, as the mechanism implied: `@js/types/posts` is app-declared
either way, so the *name* now resolves and the unresolved *module* joined the uncounted TS2307 bucket. That
bucket rose by three rather than one, because the same loop also propagated two form-request `#[TsExtends]`
imports the globals body never references. `laravel-ts-global.ts` now carries **20** imports, at lines 9-28,
six `@js/types/*` and fourteen `@/types/*`.

`AddressResource` was a real leak rather than an escape hatch, and took the count from 11 to 10 when it
was fixed. `AddressResource` carries `#[TsResource(name: 'Address')]`, so it **is**
published — as the interface `Address` in `app/http/resources/address.ts` — but `InlineArrayFqcnResource`'s
`AddressResource::make($this->user)` reference emitted the *class basename*, which nothing declares. It was
the corpus's only live instance of the counted/uncounted split
[`resource-ast-analyzer.md`](../components/resource-ast-analyzer.md) describes, showing up once per output
flavor: `TS2552` on the bare name in `laravel-ts-global.ts`, counted here, and `TS2724` on the import in
`app/http/resources/inline-array-fqcn-resource.ts` (`'"."' has no exported member named 'AddressResource'`),
counted by neither gate. Both were reproduced before the fix and both are gone after it, which is the point
worth keeping: the gate saw one of the two, so the baseline moved by 1 while 2 diagnostics disappeared.

Resolving an analyzer-derived resource reference through the same `#[TsResource]`-aware naming the publisher
uses closed it. No live instance of that split remains in the corpus. TS2305/TS2724 are **no longer the
uncounted half** — they joined the main count when the stubs landed, because a resolvable stub module turns
a leaked or renamed name into "has no exported member" rather than the TS2307 the old baseline swallowed.

The count fell `14` → `11` → `10` → `0`: step 5c of `toTsType()` inlining a value object's property shape
(which also took the relative-specifier count from `1` to `0` — one fixture change, two diagnostic codes
disappearing together), then `GlobalsWriter`'s form-request import loop, then `#[TsResource(name:)]`-aware
analyzer references, then the stubs. Lowering a baseline once the defect behind it is gone was always the
point; defending the number never was. There is no baseline left to defend.

After the stubs, `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` over the generated tree reports exactly one code:
**4** TS6196 (`declared but never used`), which no gate counts — see
[What the gates do not cover](#what-the-gates-do-not-cover).

### The TS2307 sub-gates

Two further optional arguments gate TS2307 ("Cannot find module") diagnostics — kept as **two separate
counts with two separate baselines**, not pooled into one:

- **Relative-specifier TS2307** (second argument, `RELATIVE_BASELINE`). A relative specifier (`./` or `../`)
  can only resolve against a file *this package itself writes*, so an unresolved one is never an app-side
  escape hatch — it is always the failure mode
  `PublishedResourceRegistry` exists to prevent (see [below](#what-the-gates-do-not-cover)). This baseline is
  always `0`. Unlike the other two baselines in this script, it has no legitimate non-zero cause, so it is
  never appropriate to raise it — a non-zero reading is a defect to fix, not a fixture to explain away.
- **Bare-specifier TS2307** (third argument, `BARE_BASELINE`), e.g. `@js/types/settings`, `@/types/geo`. The
  token is imported and the specifier is well-formed, and the module it names lives in the *consuming app*.
  This was an app-side escape hatch with a baseline of 61 until those modules were stubbed under
  `tests/types/stubs` and wired up by `paths`; it is now `0` and an unresolved bare specifier means either a
  genuinely new alias (add the stub) or a defect.

**Why two counts instead of one.** An earlier version of this gate summed the two into a single TS2307
baseline. That pools a zero-tolerance signal into a large, ordinarily-fluctuating one: the bare-specifier
count moved on routine fixture churn (58→59→60→61 and back down across unrelated changes), so a commit that
happened to drop one bare-alias import while separately introducing one broken relative import netted to the
same combined total and passed silently. Both counts are `0` now, which removes that particular swap, but
they stay separate: the two failures have different remedies — add a stub, versus fix the emitter — and
collapsing them would lose that distinction the moment either needed a temporary non-zero value.

Before either sub-gate existed, both flavors were an unenumerated footnote (see
[below](#what-the-gates-do-not-cover)) — nothing stopped the annotation machinery from emitting an import to
a module that does not exist, and only a live `tsc` run over the generated tree would ever have caught it.
Each sub-gate gets its own baseline rather than joining the main one above because this is a structurally
different failure (an unresolved *module*, not an unresolved *name*) with its own, distinct set of
legitimate escape hatches.

```bash
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0           # unchanged: neither TS2307 check runs
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0 0         # gate the relative-specifier count only
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0 0 0       # gate both TS2307 counts (what CI runs)
```

Each argument activates its own gate on top of the ones before it; passing fewer leaves the rest report-only
— the same truncation behavior the script already had before the bare-specifier count existed.

#### The relative-specifier baseline

**0**, always. It was `1` while
`workbench/resources/js/types/data/default-example/app/models/warehouse.ts` imported `Coordinate` from
`'../value-objects'` — the unpublished `Workbench\App\ValueObjects\Coordinate`. `toTsType()` step 5c now
inlines that class's property shape, so no relative import is emitted and the count has stayed `0` since.

#### The bare-specifier baseline

**0**, since the stubs landed. It was **61**, spanning **21 distinct module names** — `@/types/*` (14 names,
40 diagnostics), `@js/types/*` (6 names, 20) and `@workbench/types` (1) — each an app-side alias namespace
the consuming app declares. None were ever unresolved npm packages: `@tolki/ts` and `@tolki/types` are
direct dependencies and resolve cleanly, so the 61 were never a symptom of a missing `npm install`.

While it was a count it moved on ordinary fixture churn, which is exactly what made it swap-tolerant. It
rose from 58 when `GlobalsWriter` gained its form-request import loop and `laravel-ts-global.ts` picked up
three more bare specifiers; fell to 59 when step 5c stopped `warehouse.ts` importing `'../value-objects'`
(the same fixture change that took the relative-specifier count from `1` to `0` above); and fell to 60 at
`4016f7c9` (`Make relation except() expansions return columns only`), which stopped `warehouse-resource.ts`
importing `@js/types/settings`. Every one of those moves would have masked a new leaked token of the
opposite sign. `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json 2>&1 | grep "error TS2307" | grep -vE "Cannot find module
'\.{1,2}/"` reproduces the count directly; it should now print nothing.

#### Proving each gate fires

Five detection controls and one comparison control, each checked separately — a multi-count gate where
only one branch was ever exercised is not meaningfully better than the single-count gate it replaced.
Every expected number below has been reproduced against the committed tree; two of them were wrong once.

Now that every baseline is `0`, the old "one below its baseline" controls are gone: there is no lower
number to pass. Every control below is a **detection** control, which is the stronger kind anyway — it
exercises the tsc run and the grep, not just the comparison arithmetic. Most mutate a committed stub, so
restore it afterwards (`git checkout -- tests/types/stubs`); the relative-specifier control instead writes
a throwaway file and the TS2440 one edits the golden tree, so each names its own cleanup. `tests/types/`
also has its own CI step that fails on any diagnostic there.

**Bare-specifier gate — an alias nothing stubs.** Point one alias at nothing by deleting its stub:

```bash
mv tests/types/stubs/app/geo.d.ts /tmp/geo.bak
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0 0 0   # exit 1: "bare-specifier TS2307 count rose from 0 to 7"
mv /tmp/geo.bak tests/types/stubs/app/geo.d.ts
```

**Main gate — a name the stub does not export (TS2305).** This is the control the stubs *added*; before
them this shape was an unresolved module absorbed by the 61:

```bash
printf 'export interface GeoPoint {}\n' > tests/types/stubs/app/geo.d.ts   # drop GeoBounds
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0 0 0   # exit 1: "token count rose from 0 to 2", histogram "2 GeoBounds"
git checkout -- tests/types/stubs/app/geo.d.ts
```

Renaming the export instead of dropping it (`GeoBound`) raises TS2724 rather than TS2305; both are counted.

**Main gate — a `Pick` key the stub does not declare (TS2344).** Remove a member the generated tree picks:

```bash
printf 'export interface Routable {\n    update: unknown;\n}\n' > tests/types/stubs/app/routing.d.ts
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0 0 0   # exit 1: "token count rose from 0 to 4" (TS2344)
git checkout -- tests/types/stubs/app/routing.d.ts
```

4 is the ceiling, not an arbitrary reading: the checked tree holds exactly four `Pick<Routable, …>` sites —
`routable-resource.ts:5`, `warehouse-resource.ts:16`, and `laravel-ts-global.ts` at `:3040` and `:3487`.
The histogram does not collapse TS2344 to a name; its `sed` matches only quoted identifiers, so these four
print as whole diagnostic lines.

**Main gate — an import colliding with a local declaration (TS2440).** No stub is involved: the collision
has to be *in* a generated file, so this is the one control that mutates the golden tree. Restore it:

```bash
printf '\nexport interface GeoPoint {\n    lat: unknown;\n}\n' \
  >> workbench/resources/js/types/data/default-example/app/http/resources/address.ts
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0 0 0   # exit 1: "token count rose from 0 to 1", histogram "1 GeoPoint"
git checkout -- workbench/resources/js/types/data/default-example/app/http/resources/address.ts
```

Before TS2440 joined the grep, that same mutation left all three counts at `0` and the gate exited **0** —
the diagnostic was in the `tsc` output the whole time, just not in the pattern reading it.

**Relative-specifier gate.** No stub is involved — synthesize an unresolvable relative import:

```bash
printf "import type { Nope } from './deliberately-missing';\nexport type Control = Nope;\n" > tests/types/relative-subgate-control.ts
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0 0 0   # exit 1: "relative-specifier TS2307 count rose from 0 to 1"
rm tests/types/relative-subgate-control.ts
```

*Comparison control (no setup).* A negative baseline makes `rel_count -gt relative_baseline` true no matter
the committed count, so this fails against the committed tree with nothing to clean up:

```bash
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0 -1 0   # exit 1: "relative-specifier TS2307 count rose from -1 to 0"
```

It only exercises the threshold branch — the grep feeding it is not under test — so it is a weaker check
than the synthesized import, not a substitute for it.

### Fails closed

If `tsc` cannot run at all — bad `tsconfig.json`, missing binary, an `include` matching nothing — it emits
no TS2304 lines, which a naive grep reads as a pass. The script distinguishes setup errors (printed
unanchored) from real diagnostics (always prefixed `file(line,col):`) and fails on the former.

One residual limit: it still passes if `tsc` checks *fewer* files than intended while checking something.

### When it fails

A type token reached the output without its import. The generated TypeScript will not compile. The fix is
never to add the import by hand — the type resolution that produced the token must either carry the FQCN
through to the import machinery, or degrade to `unknown`.

This failure mode recurred nine times during the type-inference work, and every instance had the same
shape: a `return` that fired before a guard. If you hit it, prefer restructuring the accept/reject decision
into a single check over all fields rather than reordering two branches.

## The `@tolki/ts` patch and `tests/types/tolki-assertions.ts`

`@tolki/ts` ships two declaration files whose first line imports from
`'../packages/types/src/index.ts'` — a monorepo source path that does not exist inside the published
tarball. `dist/enums.d.ts` and `dist/routes.d.ts` both have it, and `dist/index.d.ts` is only
`export * from './enums'; export * from './routes';`, so the package's **entire** type surface flows
through one of the two broken imports.

**Versions known to carry the defect: `0.2.0` and `1.0.1`.** The `1.0.1` major bump did not fix it, and
the two `dist` files are byte-identical between the two releases — so the patch regenerated against
`1.0.1` is identical to the original `0.2.0` one. Before assuming a newer release is fixed, check the
**pristine tarball**, never `node_modules`:

```bash
npm pack @tolki/ts@<version> && tar xzf tolki-ts-<version>.tgz && head -1 package/dist/enums.d.ts
```

Reading `node_modules` after any install is misleading: `postinstall` has already run `patch-package`, so
a successfully patched file is indistinguishable from a genuine upstream fix.

`skipLibCheck: true` suppresses the resulting TS2307s, and the failure is then completely silent:
every exported type degrades to `any`. `AsEnum<typeof Status>` accepted `.totallyBogusProperty` and was
assignable to `string`; `defineEnum`'s result was `any`, so `Status.Draft`, `.from()`, `.tryFrom()` and
`.cases()` were all unchecked. Nothing in the suite or either gate noticed.

Two fixes do **not** work:

| Candidate | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `skipLibCheck: false` | Surfaces the two TS2307s but does not repair the type — still `any` |
| `paths` mapping in `tsconfig.json` | Never consulted: TypeScript applies `paths` only to *non-relative* specifiers, and `../packages/types/src/index.ts` is relative |

The repair is `patches/@tolki+ts+1.0.1.patch`, applied by `patch-package` from the `postinstall` hook.
It rewrites both specifiers to the bare name `@tolki/types`, which is why `@tolki/types` is a **direct**
dependency rather than only a transitive one — the bare specifier must be guaranteed to resolve.
**Delete the patch, the `postinstall` hook and the direct dependency once a fixed `@tolki/ts` ships**;
the real fix belongs in that package's dts emitter.

The patch filename encodes the version it was generated against. When `@tolki/ts` is upgraded,
`patch-package` warns of a version mismatch on install and keeps applying the old patch as long as its
context lines still match. Regenerate with `npx patch-package @tolki/ts` and delete the stale file, so
the filename never misstates what is actually installed.

`tests/types/tolki-assertions.ts` is the permanent regression guard and must stay inside `tsconfig.json`'s
`include`. Note how it is written: an `IsAny<T>` conditional **cannot** work here. When an import fails to
resolve, TypeScript propagates its *error type* through the conditional and suppresses the cascading
diagnostic, so `IsAny<AsEnum<…>>` yields the error type rather than `true` and the assertion silently
passes in exactly the broken state it is meant to catch. The guard instead uses `@ts-expect-error` on a
deliberate constraint violation (`AsEnum<string>`, `RouteCallResult<number>`): when the types are real
those raise TS2344 and the directive is satisfied, and when they have degraded to `any` no error occurs
and TypeScript reports **TS2578 "Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive"** — which is emitted by the
directive machinery and therefore survives `any`-poisoning.

`unimportable-token-gate.sh` counts only TS2300/TS2304/TS2305/TS2344/TS2440/TS2552/TS2724, so it does
**not** fail on TS2578.
CI evaluates this guard in its own step (`Gate - the @tolki/ts type surface resolves`), which fails on any
diagnostic under `tests/types/`. Locally:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json 2>&1 | grep "^tests/types/"   # must print nothing
```

## Running both

```bash
composer test -- --passthru-php="-d memory_limit=1024M"   # regenerates the trees
python3 .github/scripts/unknown-regression-gate.py
.github/scripts/unimportable-token-gate.sh 0 0 0
```

Run the suite first — both gates read the committed trees, so they check whatever the last test run wrote.

The `--passthru-php` flag is needed when the local `php.ini` caps memory below ~512M; paratest spawns
workers that re-read `php.ini`, so `php -d` on the parent process does not reach them.

When changing `unknown-regression-gate.py` itself, also run its
[parser self-test](#parser-self-test): `python3 .github/scripts/unknown-regression-gate.py --parsetest`.

## What the gates do not cover

- **Fixture coverage.** They read the **committed workbench corpus**, so they only see failures the
  fixtures actually produce. A defect reachable only by a shape no fixture exercises passes both. When
  adding an inference path, add a fixture for the hazardous shape too — several real defects were found
  only by constructing a fixture and regenerating, never by reading the code or running the suite.

- **TS2307 (`Cannot find module`) is counted, in two separate counts, not the main one.**
  `unimportable-token-gate.sh`'s main count greps only TS2300/TS2304/TS2305/TS2344/TS2440/TS2552/TS2724, and an
  unresolved *module* is not an existing property degrading to `unknown`, so the regression gate is
  structurally blind to a bad import too. [The TS2307 sub-gates](#the-ts2307-sub-gates) above are where every
  TS2307 is counted instead, kept apart on purpose: the relative-specifier count, whose diagnostic is the signature of
  an import of a class the package never writes a file for (the failure mode `PublishedResourceRegistry`
  exists to prevent, documented under
  [convention guesses are gated on the published set](../components/resource-ast-analyzer.md#toresource-convention-guesses-are-gated-on-the-published-set),
  including its shared `InspectsAstNodes::resolveCollectedResourceClass()` resolver, which both
  `ResourceAstAnalyzer` and `InertiaPageAnalyzer` call), and the bare-specifier count, gated separately so
  that ordinary bare-alias churn can never mask a new relative-specifier regression inside a combined total.

  `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` now reports **0** TS2307s of either flavor. Counting the bare half
  closed the gap this bullet used to describe; stubbing the modules it counted (see
  [The app-side stubs](#the-app-side-stubs)) removed the 61 themselves, so neither sub-gate carries a
  tolerance any more.

- **TS6196 (`declared but never used`) is counted by neither gate, and there are 4.** They are a genuine
  pre-existing emitter defect, unrelated to the stubs and present at the same count before them.
  `laravel-ts-global.ts` emits the `#[TsExtends]` **import** for broadcast events and form requests
  (`BroadcastableEvent`, `FormRequestBase`, `HasValidationMeta`) but drops the corresponding `extends`
  clause, which the per-file output does emit — so the global flavor silently loses the interface
  composition while keeping a now-unused import. (The import half of this was already noted above, as
  "`#[TsExtends]` imports the globals body never references"; the missing `extends` is the other half.) The
  fourth is an unused `RoleType` import in `to-array-casts-resource.ts`. Adding TS6196 to the gate would
  fail immediately, so it is recorded rather than gated; fixing it means changing what the package emits
  and re-baselining the golden tree.

- **An inline object that already contains `unknown` cannot report its own wholesale collapse.**
  `detect_regressions()` gates the base side on the substring test `"unknown" not in b[k]`, and the
  restored parent key's value is the *whole rendered object*. So one already-`unknown` member anywhere
  inside an object disarms that object's own parent key; when the object then collapses to a bare
  `unknown`, its member keys are absent from the head snapshot and nothing is left to match. This is the
  gate's founding design, not a regression — the same substring test disarmed the parent key before
  member splitting existed — but it is a real residual and the prose above is scoped to it.

  Measured at `HEAD`: **1104** top-level inline-object properties, **128** of them already carrying
  `unknown` (about 12%). At the default base rev `a6c268da`: **576** and **72**. Real exposure is the
  real-typed members sitting under those dirty parents — **120** member keys across six property names
  (`meta`, `tree_from_docblock`, `metadata`, `grid_config`, `shipping`, `grid_configs`), with at most
  **3** real members in any one property. The other eight dirty property names have no real-typed member
  at all, so nothing could be lost there. Re-derive these with a snapshot diff rather than quoting them;
  they move with every regeneration.

- **Removed properties are structurally invisible to `unknown-regression-gate.py`.** The comparison loop
  is `[... for k in h if k in b and ...]` — it only ever looks at keys present in the **head** snapshot,
  then checks whether that same `(file, scope, property)` key existed in the base snapshot. A property
  that existed at `BASE_REV` and is simply **gone** at `HEAD` never appears in `h`, so it never enters the
  loop at all — not as a pass, not as a fail, not as any kind of signal. The gate has no code path that
  even notices a key vanished.

  This is not theoretical: this branch shipped the first base-only property **roots** the gate has
  ever seen, both from the write-only-accessor waterfall (`cb7c302`). `order.search_index` was dropped
  outright — a set-only mutator with no getter, no docblock generic, and no backing column, so it is
  correctly omitted rather than emitted as `unknown`. `profile.normalized_phone` was *moved*: in the
  three split-template trees it left `ProfileMutators` and reappeared in `Profile`, where the
  same-named column types it `string | null` instead of `unknown`. Because keys are scoped by
  enclosing interface, a relocation is a removal plus an addition, and the gate is blind to exactly
  the half that would tell you a property left its old home. (In `full-template-example` the same
  change is fully visible — one interface holds both sections, so the key never moved and the gate
  simply saw `unknown` become `string | null`. Whether a change is observable can depend on the
  template, which is its own reason not to treat a green gate as coverage.)

  Keep the base-only *root* separate from the base-only *key*. Member splitting keys each inline object's
  members individually, so any property that changes shape strands its old member keys on the base side.
  Base-rev→HEAD currently has 867 base-only keys and only 35 property roots among them: the `search_index`
  (32) and `normalized_phone` (3) entries above, and nothing else. The other 832 sit under nine roots whose
  own key is present on both sides, every one a property that was an inline `{ … }` at base and is a
  `Pick<Model, K>` at head — `Pick<>` has no `{` to descend into, so its members stop being keyed
  separately (see [Aliases and inline-object members](#aliases-and-inline-object-members)). Those are
  noise, not signal. Re-measure rather than quoting these counts; they move whenever any property's shape
  changes.

  What did **not** ship is a `$hidden` removal, and it is worth being precise about that, because it is
  the change most likely to be misremembered as one. `config/ts-publish.php` ships
  `'exclude_hidden' => false`, so hidden attributes are published by default: `user.password` and
  `user.remember_token` are both still present, in all four committed trees. The setting is the opt-in
  that *would* remove them — turn it on and those two properties leave `User` on the next regeneration,
  matching Laravel's own `toArray()`/`toJson()` serialization (see
  [What gets published](https://tolki.abe.dev/ts/models.html#what-gets-published-hidden-attributes-write-only-accessors)).
  No workbench example enables it, so the committed corpus exercises the permissive branch only and the
  gate has never actually been shown a `$hidden`-driven removal — a second reason not to lean on it here.

  Every regenerated tree was reviewed by hand — reading the diff and confirming each property disappeared
  for the intended reason — because the gate could not do, and did not do, any part of that verification.
  A property quietly dropping for the *wrong* reason (a bug, not a deliberate design choice) would pass
  both gates exactly the same way these did.

  **Practical consequence:** whenever a change might remove a property — excluding more columns, widening
  `$hidden`, tightening an accessor's visibility, deleting or renaming a workbench fixture — diff the
  regenerated `workbench/resources/js/types/data` tree by hand (`git diff` on the committed output) and
  account for every property that disappears. Neither gate substitutes for that review. Teaching the gate
  to see removals — a second pass keyed the opposite direction (`for k in b if k not in h`), reporting each
  base-only key as a `REMOVED — verify intentional` line rather than an automatic failure, since removal is
  often correct — is real, scoped work, deliberately left for a follow-up rather than folded into this
  documentation-only task.
