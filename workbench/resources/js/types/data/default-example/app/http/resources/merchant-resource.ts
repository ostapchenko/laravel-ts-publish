/**
 * Exercises Model::toResource() / Collection::toResourceCollection() resolution: naming
 * convention, #[UseResource], explicit arguments, the unresolvable negative cases, and
 * (registrar/registrars/suppliers) the three resolution orderings against a losing
 * candidate that also exists, so an inverted order would visibly fail.
 *
 * The unpublished_guess pair covers the published-set gate: the guessed AttachmentResource and
 * AttachmentCollection both exist but are #[TsExclude]d, so neither is ever written and the
 * convention branches must reject them (see PublishedResourceRegistry).
 *
 * Also reuses the staff/registrars/historyEvent relations for the ->map->only()/->except()
 * HigherOrderCollectionProxy: a to-many whenLoaded param is a bound collection and matches,
 * a singular one (historyEvent) is not and must stay unknown.
