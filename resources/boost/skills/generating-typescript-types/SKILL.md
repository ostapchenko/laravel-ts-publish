    Use when working in a Laravel app that has abetwothree/laravel-ts-publish installed and
    frontend TypeScript types under resources/js/types are missing, stale, or need regenerating —
    after adding or editing a PHP enum, Eloquent model, API resource, form request, route,
    broadcast channel, or broadcast event; when a property or method must be hidden from the
    generated output; when a generated type is wrong or missing a new column/relation; or when
    `php artisan ts:publish` or its Vite plugin doesn't behave as expected.
compatibility: Requires abetwothree/laravel-ts-publish (PHP 8.4+, Laravel 12/13) installed via Composer.

## Workflow

1. After adding/editing one PHP enum, model, resource, form request, route, or broadcast
   class, regenerate just that class — much faster than a full rebuild:
    ```bash
    php artisan ts:publish --source="Fully\Qualified\ClassName"
    # or a file path:
    php artisan ts:publish --source="app/Models/Post.php"
    ```
2. To check output before writing files, add `--preview=true` (see gotcha below — bare `--preview` does nothing).
3. If types look wrong/stale across the whole app (config change, first run, suspected stale cache), do a full rebuild: `php artisan ts:publish --fresh`.
4. To hide a specific accessor/relation/method/property — or an entire class — from the output, add `#[TsExclude]` to it. It always wins over every other attribute or config.
5. To shape what a member generates as, use the attributes in the table below.
6. If a `--source` run doesn't seem to "take," run a full `php artisan ts:publish` — barrel `index.ts` files only refresh on full runs (see gotcha below).

Mutually exclusive — passing two of these errors out.                                                                                                            |

If a `--only-*` flag requests a type disabled in `config/ts-publish.php`, an interactive run
prompts to override; a non-interactive run (CI, queued job, the post-migration hook) silently
respects the config and skips it.

## Key attributes

| Attribute                                   | Use on                                         | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `#[TsExclude]`                              | class or member                                | Drop it from output entirely. Always wins.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `#[TsEnumMethod]` / `#[TsEnumStaticMethod]` | enum method                                    | Expose that method to TS. **Required** unless `enums.auto_include_methods` / `auto_include_static_methods` is `true` (both default `false`) — a plain public enum method is otherwise invisible to TS. |
| `#[TsEnum]` / `#[TsCase]`                   | enum / case                                    | Rename it or add a JSDoc description.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `#[TsCasts]` / `#[TsType]`                  | generated property or cast class               | Override or add a TypeScript type, including a custom import.                                                                                                                                         |
| `#[TsExtends]`                              | model, resource, form request, broadcast event | Add an `extends` clause to the generated interface (repeatable, inherited from parents/traits).                                                                                                        |
| `#[TsResource(model:)]` / `#[UseResource]`  | `JsonResource`                                 | Point at the backing model when `@mixin` or naming convention doesn't already resolve it.                                                                                                              |

## Model metadata

When enabled, model metadata writes a runtime `{model}_meta.ts` companion. Prefer a precise `@return array{...}` on the provider's `provide()` method so static analysis can validate its contract. For generic `array<string, mixed>` declarations, import-free types fall back to body inference. PHPDoc then refines those types and declares optional or dynamic keys; `#[TsCasts]` has final precedence and owns explicit overrides and imports. Metadata finder settings inherit the model finder settings when omitted.

Optional shape keys may be absent. Undeclared keys, missing required keys, unsupported values, and named types without an import-aware `#[TsCasts]` override fail generation.

## Output layout & imports

Generated files live below `output_directory` (default `resources/js/types/data/`) in their configured namespace, mirroring PHP namespaces with kebab-cased segments: `App\Models\User` becomes `app/models/user.ts`. Full runs refresh barrel `index.ts` files; source and partial model/metadata runs preserve existing exports.

### Importing types, enum objects, & routes

#### TypeScript imports

When importing types created by this tool, unless configured differently, you should import from the configured `@data` alias (or whatever you have set in your `ts:publish` config) rather than relative paths. It should almost match the PHP file namespace in kebab-case, segment by segment.

e.g.:

```ts
import type { User } from "@data/app/models/user";
import type { StatusType } from "@data/app/enums/status";
import type { UserResource } from "@data/app/http/resources/user-resource";

defineProps<{
    user: User;
    status: StatusType;
    userResource: UserResource;
}>();
```

#### Enum object imports

When importing enum objects created by this tool, you should also import from the configured `@data` alias, e.g.:

```ts
import { UserRole } from "@data/app/enums/user-role";

UserRole.Admin; // Accessing the enum case value
```

#### Routes functions imports

When importing route functions created by this tool, you should also import from the configured `@data` alias, e.g.:

```ts
import { router } from "@inertiajs/react";

// Imports the entire UserController object with all its route functions
import UserController from "@data/app/http/controllers/user-controller";

UserController.index(); // Accessing a route function from the controller
UserController.show(1); // Accessing another route function from the controller

router.post(UserController.update(3, updateData));
```

```ts
import { router } from "@inertiajs/vue";

// Import a specific route function from the controller
import {
    index,
    show,
    update,
} from "@data/app/http/controllers/user-controller";

index(); // Accessing the imported route function
show(1); // Accessing another imported route function
update(3, updateData); // Accessing the imported update route function
```

## Gotchas

- **`--preview` needs `=true`.** It's declared as `{--preview=false}`, so a bare `--preview` flag (no `=value`) resolves to `null`, and `filter_var(null, FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN)` is `false` — the run silently writes real files instead of previewing.
- **`--source` skips barrel files and always bypasses the cache.** Expect only the target file to change; the aggregated `index.ts` files, and anything cache-related, need a full run.
- **Auto-include is off by default.** `enums.auto_include_methods` / `auto_include_static_methods` both default to `false`; tag methods with `#[TsEnumMethod]` / `#[TsEnumStaticMethod]` or they won't appear in the generated enum object.
- **Runs automatically after migrations** unless disabled (`run_after_migrate` config or `TS_PUBLISH_RUN_AFTER_MIGRATE=false`).
- **Vite plugin runs via Node's `child_process.exec()`** — shell aliases like a bare `sail` don't resolve. If Vite runs on the host with Sail, point the plugin's `command` at `./vendor/bin/sail artisan ts:publish` instead of `sail artisan ts:publish`.
- **`EnumResource`** (`AbeTwoThree\LaravelTsPublish\EnumResource`) returns a flattened JSON representation of a single enum case for API responses, running through the same `#[TsEnumMethod]`/`#[TsEnumStaticMethod]` pipeline — pair it with the `AsEnum<T>` type from `@tolki/ts` on the frontend instead of hand-writing the shape.
