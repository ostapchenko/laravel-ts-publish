# Standing gate: the generated TypeScript must not gain any new "Cannot find
# name" (TS2304, or TS2552 when a similarly-named global exists) error — that
# is precisely the signature of a type token emitted without its import. It
# also counts TS2300 "Duplicate identifier" errors: two different imports
# resolving to the same local name, e.g. two unrelated MailPrice models both
# aliased to MailPriceMailPrice (see docs/components/import-name-registry.md).
# TS2440 is that same collision against a *local* declaration rather than a
# second import, which TypeScript reports under its own code and not as TS2300.
# TS2344 rounds out the set: a token that IS imported but named where its own
# type rejects it, e.g. Pick<Model, K> over a key the interface never declares.
# TS2305/TS2724 cover the name that IS imported from a module that resolves but
# never exports it - the shape that only became reachable once the stubs landed.
#
# The unknown-regression gate cannot catch either shape: a leaked or colliding
# token is a NEW property with a plausible-looking type, not an existing
# property degrading to `unknown`.
#
# Every baseline is 0. The app-side modules the generated tree imports (`#[TsCasts]` /
# `#[TsExtends]` targets) are stubbed under tests/types/stubs and wired up by tsconfig
# `paths`, so an unresolved module is now always a defect rather than a known absence.
#
# Usage: unimportable-token-gate.sh [BASELINE_COUNT] [RELATIVE_BASELINE] [BARE_BASELINE]
#        With no argument it prints the current counts and the offending names. RELATIVE_BASELINE
#        gates TS2307s whose specifier is relative (./ or ../) - a module this package itself writes.
#        BARE_BASELINE gates every other TS2307 - a bare specifier such as @/types/geo, now backed by
#        a stub. All three are 0 and none has a legitimate non-zero cause, so raising any of them is
#        never the fix: a rise means a token leaked, a name moved, or a stub needs the new export
#        added by hand. Nothing machine-checks that a stub declares only the names the tree actually
#        imports, so widening one to silence a TS2305 is that same escape relocated, not a fix.
#        Each argument activates its own gate; passing fewer leaves the rest
#        report-only, same as BASELINE_COUNT and RELATIVE_BASELINE already did before BARE_BASELINE.
